1. The Basic Entry point of Guice is the Injector and you say for which all Modules you want to create Injectors, hence you send a list
of Modules to the createInjector method.

2.With Bindings you tell how Guice is going to inject dependencies in the class.

3. A binding is defined in the module class - AbstractModule. The implementation says which implementation to provide when
Webdriver variable is created and used(in our case). Module class has the implementation of the bindings.

4.  Guice.createInjector() takes your Modules, and returns a new Injector
        * instance. Most applications will call this method exactly once, in their
        * main() method.
